C - File I/O


File I/O (Input/Output) in the C programming language allows you to work with files on your computer's storage system. It enables you to read data from files and write data to files. C provides several functions and modes to perform file I/O operations. Here's an overview of how file I/O works in C:

1. File Pointers:
In C, file I/O is managed using file pointers. A file pointer is a special data type that keeps track of the current position in the file. You use file pointers to open, read, write, and close files.

2. Opening a File:
To work with a file, you first need to open it using the fopen() function. The fopen() function takes two arguments: the file name and the mode in which you want to open the file (read, write, append, etc.). It returns a pointer to the opened file.

3. Reading from a File:
You can use functions like fgetc(), fgets(), and fscanf() to read data from a file.

4. Writing to a File:
To write data to a file, you can use functions like fputc(), fputs(), and fprintf().

5. Closing a File:
After performing operations on a file, it's important to close it using the fclose() function. This ensures that any pending data is written to the file and resources are properly released.

Remember to handle errors while opening and closing files to ensure robustness in your code.

These are just basic examples of file I/O in C. There are more advanced functions and techniques available for handling binary files, random access, error handling, and more. Always refer to the C documentation for detailed information and best practices.
