# 0x09-static_libraries

## What is a C Static Library?

* A static library is a compiled object file containing all symbols required by 
* the main program to operate (functions, variables etc.) as opposed to having to pull in separate entities.
* Static libraries arenâ€™t loaded by the compiler at run-time; only the executable file need be loaded.
