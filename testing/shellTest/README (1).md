## Installation

To start programming in C, you'll need to set up your environment. Follow these steps for a smooth start:

1. **C Compiler**: Install a C compiler like GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) on your system. If you're using Ubuntu, you can install it by running the command `sudo apt install build-essential`.

2. **Choosing an Editor**:
Next, choose an editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to write and run your C code. Here are a few popular options:

- **Visual Studio Code**: Download and install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). It has excellent support for C and provides a variety of extensions.

- **Code::Blocks**: [Code::Blocks](https://www.codeblocks.org/) is a free, open-source, cross-platform IDE that supports multiple compilers including GCC.

3. **Writing Your First C Program**:
Open your chosen editor and create a new file with a `.c` extension (e.g., `hello.c`).

Save the file and open a terminal or command prompt. Navigate to the directory where you saved `hello.c` and compile it using a command like `gcc -o hello hello.c`. Finally, run the program by typing `./hello` in the terminal. You should see `Hello, World!` printed in the terminal.

4. **Additional Resources**:
For more detailed information and tutorials, consider referring to resources like online C programming courses, books, and forums. Websites like [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-programming-language/) and [Cprogramming.com](https://www.cprogramming.com/) offer excellent tutorials and examples for learning C.
