# 0x14-bit_manipulation

Bit manipulation in C involves the manipulation of individual bits within variables. This technique is often used for various purposes, such as setting, clearing, toggling, and checking the status of specific bits in integers or other data types. Bit manipulation can be very efficient and is commonly used in embedded systems, low-level programming, and optimizing algorithms.

Here are some common bitwise operators and operations used in C for bit manipulation:

Bitwise AND (&): The AND operator performs a bitwise AND operation between two operands, setting a bit only if both corresponding bits are set in both operands.

Bitwise OR (|): The OR operator performs a bitwise OR operation between two operands, setting a bit if either corresponding bit is set in either operand.

Bitwise XOR (^): The XOR operator performs a bitwise XOR operation between two operands, setting a bit only if the corresponding bits are different in the two operands.

Bitwise NOT (~): The NOT operator performs a bitwise NOT operation on a single operand, flipping all the bits (0 becomes 1, and 1 becomes 0).

Left Shift (<<): The left shift operator shifts the bits of the left operand to the left by a specified number of positions, filling the vacant bits with zeros.

Right Shift (>>): The right shift operator shifts the bits of the left operand to the right by a specified number of positions. For signed integers, the sign bit is extended to preserve the sign.
